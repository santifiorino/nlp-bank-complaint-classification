# Product Complaint Classification for Banks

This NLP project aims to classify user complaints regarding various banking products. Given a plain text complaint as input, the model predicts the specific product the user is complaining about, such as credit cards, mortgages, checking accounts, and more.

## Example:

Get the dataset running:

```bash
python add_annotations_to_dataset.py
```

That script will generate the dataset called _wells_fargo.csv_.
